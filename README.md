# My i3 Config 🚀

This is my i3 config file, made for azerty keyboards. It's nothing fancy but I like it and it does the job.

The setup is designed for a dual-monitor setup:
- Display 2: Workspaces AZER. (my left monitor) 🖥️
- Display 1: Workspaces UIOP. (my main monitor) 🖥️

The modifier key is set to Alt. ⌨️
